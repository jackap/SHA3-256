All the implemented functions are in keccak.c
In keccak.h you can find declarations and macros. 
Unfortunately I was not able to write all the code using linux kernel syle but I have avoided to write long commands. 
You can set the variable VERBOSE to 1 if you want to take a look bto the output of program. 

I have inserted some implementative details for the most important functions
